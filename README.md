# Content Management System API

This is a system for managing content for a distributed system in a centralized manner.
Think of a situation where you need the same content distributed across multiple systems.
These bits of content can be managed by different people with different access rights,
and bundled up in an easy to manage contract for consumption. That's the goal of this.
